Experimenting with joining data to sub-national admin boundaries.

ISSUE :
There are usually difficulties in joining data to admin boundaries due to spelling, capitalisation and accents.

afrimapr wants to improve that.

First want to document some of the difficulties in the wild.

Also this can be part of upcoming training material.

Reference : 
Good outlines in here that we can borrow some parts from.
https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/attr.html#vector-attribute-joining
Vignette on joins that goes further, still doesn't provide much advice on how to join when names don't match :
https://geocompr.github.io/geocompkg/articles/join.html
From R for datascience, some good diagrams but terminology a bit advanced. Short section on join problems.
https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#join-problems
"Check that your foreign keys match primary keys in another table. The best way to do this is with an anti_join(). It’s common for keys not to match because of data entry errors. Fixing these is often a lot of work."

"Be aware that simply checking the number of rows before and after the join is not sufficient to ensure that your join has gone smoothly. If you have an inner join with duplicate keys in both tables, you might get unlucky as the number of dropped rows might exactly equal the number of duplicated rows!"

fuzzyjoin package :
https://github.com/dgrtwo/fuzzyjoin

safejoin package looks good but in early development and not on CRAN :
could provide inspiration for advice to provide to new users

# so the airports data from HDX reportedly from RNIS doesn't have Goma airport
# and the data from HDX from OSM doesn't have Gisenyi or Kigali
# 3 helipads don't have names

# an exercise could be to make a complete airports dataset for rwanda

# to get a dataset based on both
# we can 'bind' the rows together using rbind, but first they need to have the same columns
# if we try to bind them together when they have different columns an error will be generated

#   User input: WGS 84 etc.
sf::st_crs(sfairports)

# can set the one that is not specified from the other

#once the crs's match then get the error that the numbers of columns don't match

# dplyr::bind_rows does similar job allows binding and fills in empty columns with NAs
sfairportsboth <- dplyr::bind_rows(sfosmairports, sfairports)

# we can select & rename columns before the binding to make the final output cleaner & more useful
# we want to have the two files with the same column names with useful information in

# mutate allows us to rename columns, select to restrict columns
